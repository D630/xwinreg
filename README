NAME
       xwinreg - organize X windows into regions and do tiling layouts

SYNOPSIS
       xwinreg [-F]
               [-C|-T|-n|-N|-a|-fx|-fy|-fw|-fh|-wx|-wy|-ww|-wh]
               (-c|-f|-H|-h|[-l ...|-L...]|-M|-m|-O|-o|-s|-U|-v|-y)

REQUIREMENT
       bc, GNU bash, GNU grep, GNU sed, wmctrl, xprop, xwinpp

DESCRIPTION
       xwinreg is a bash shell script that acts like a stupid third
       party tiling application on Xorg. It lets you to organize X windows
       into frames and regions and then to build your own layouts in a
       simple way. Therefore, xwinreg uses xwinpp to prepare a list of X
       window ids, and wmctrl to interact with your EWMH/NetWM compatible
       X Window manager. See section CONCEPTION in this manpage.

OPTIONS
       -F, --file= FILE
              Obtain output of xwinpp from FILE. If FILE is a hyphen, get
              output from xwinpp by reading from standard input (pipe).

       -C, --conf-file= FILE
              Read variables from FILE. See section CONFIGURATION in
              this manpage.

       -T, --tmp-file= FILE
              Before layouting, xwinreg creates a Tmp File, whose
              variables are needed by all other actions to work with.
              With this option you can specify a nonregular file.

       -n, --number-of-rows= INT
              Specify number of rows for grid layouting.

       -N, --number-of-cols= INT
              Specify number of columns for grid layouting.

       -a, --frame-alias= FRAMEALIAS
              Instead of options -fx, -fy, -fw and -fh specify an alias.
              See section CONFIGURATION in this manpage.

       -fx, --frame-x= PX
              Specify the left edge of the frame.

       -fy, --frame-y= PX
              Specify the top edge of the frame.

       -fw, --frame-width= PX
              Specify the WIDTH of the frame.

       -fh, --frame-height= PX
              Specify the HEIGHT of the frame.

       -wx, --workarea-x= PX
              Specify the left edge of the workarea.

       -wy, --workarea-y= PX
              Specify the top edge of the workarea.

       -ww, --workarea-width= PX
              Specify the WIDTH of the workarea.

       -wh, --workarea-height= PX
              Specify the HEIGHT of the workarea.

       -h, --help
              Display a short help.

       -v, --version
              Print current version of xwinreg.

                -L 1,max,horizontal,alias:0,all

              xwinpp -F ./list -P 1 -p | xwinreg -F - \
                -L 1,max,grid-horizontal,alias:0,all

              xwinpp -F ./list -P 1 -p | xwinreg -F - \

                -L 1,max,maximize,alias:0,all

              xwinpp -F ./list -P 1 -p | xwinreg -F - \
                -L 1,1,maximize,alias:0,west \

                -L 2,1,maximize,alias:0,northeast \
                -L 3,max,vertical,alias:0,southeast

       To do some cycling (still with five windows in three regions):
              xwinreg -y -w -r all -d reverse

              xwinreg -y -w -r active -d clock

              xwinreg -y -w -r 1,3 -d anticlock

              xwinreg -y -d anticlock

              xwinreg -y -k -d clock

       To do some moving with two windows and two regions:
              xwinpp -F ./list -P 1 -p | xwinreg -F - \
                -L 1,1,maximize,alias:0,northeast \

              xwinreg -m -r all -e pro -R region -g 100 -d west

       To do some sizing with three windows and two regions:
              xwinpp -F ./lis -P1 -p | xwinreg -F - \
                -L 1,1,maximize,alias:0,north \
                -L 2,max,maximize,alias:0,south

              xwinreg -s -w -r 2 -e pro -R window -g -,50

              xwinreg -s -w -r 2 -e pro -R window -g -,200

              xwinreg -s -r active -e pro -R frame -g 50,50

NOTES
       ·   You may write all long commands and options without masking --.
           So, instead of --help you may use help.

       ·   If no workarea geometry is set, xwinreg uses _NET_WORKAREA.

       ·   Currently, window decoration is not considered.

       ·   If no frame geometry is set, _NET_WORKAREA is used as frame.
           Every new frame needs its own Tmp File. In other words: all
           layouting takes place in one frame. You can specify another
           Tmp File with option -T, or you may  create several Conf
           Files. See section CONFIGURATION in this manpage.

       ·   If you use actions -m and -s with option -w, only new
           window-geometries are updated in the Tmp File. Without option
           -w the hole Tmp File is rewritten.

CONFIGURATIONS
       By default, xwinreg needs no Conf File, because all important
       geometries will be calculated in the script. You can also use
       the relating options on command line. So, only use a Conf File,
       if you want to work with several frames (and several Tmp Files
       are needed) or if you need to set own aliases for frame and
       region geometries. Along with this programm comes a Example Conf
       File. Specify a Conf File with option -C or use XWINREG_CONF_FILE.
       You can set following parameters:

       enviroment variables:
              XWINREG_TMP_FILE=FILE
              XWINREG_INPUT_FILE=FILE

       normal scalar variables:
              workarea_x=PX
              workarea_y=PX
              workarea_width=PX
              workarea_height=PX
              frame_x=PX
              frame_y=PX
              frame_width=PX
              frame_height=PX
              row_number=INT
              col_number=INT

       associativ array variables (you can use it with above variables).
       You need to set them inside a function called
       __calculating_frame_alias respectively __calculating_region_alias
       and declare it with 'declare -gA frames' respectively 'declare
       -gA regions':
              frames[ALIAS]="X Y W H"
              regions[ALIAS]="X Y W H"

ENVIROMENT
       TMPDIR
              By default, Tmp File will be written as
              TMPDIR/xwinreg_default.tmp, otherwise as
              /tmp/xwinreg_default.tmp.

        XWINREG_TMP_FILE
              Specify this instead default setting and instead
              use of XWINREG_TMP_FILE in a Conf File.

        XWINREG_CONF_FILE
              Use this instead of option -C, if you want to use an Conf
              File.
        XWINREG_INPUT_FILE
              Use this instead of option -F.

CHRONICLE
       First version (0.1.0.0) was finished on: 2014-02-10.

CONCEPTION
       xwinpp reads a list with X window ids and does a preparing
       output with variables, which will be read by xwinreg. By using
       action layout or layout-abbrev a layout will be generated and all
       specified windows will be ordered. In the course of layouting a
       Tmp File with some variables will be created. Any other actions
       then need to access that Tmp File to work properly. Only above
       layout actions must be used in combination with  xwinpp; no
       windows to read are needed any more.

       The layout will be set on one desktop. Therefore, xwinreg reads
       _NET_WORKAREA and determines a frame as scale base to have
       base geometry. In this frame xwinreg arranges regions, which
       will be filled rule-based with the windows. Windows are taken
       in list-order; the first window will be set as first window in
       the first region. You can determine, how many windows a region
       should have (maximum is the number of imported windows). The
       windows will be split and positioned with following functions:
       maximize, vertical, horizontal, grid-vertical, grid-horizontal,
       grid-square-vertical, grid-square-horizontal.

       In other words: all layouting takes place in one frame. That
       one frame may have geometry of the workspace or any other. To
       work with more than one frame, you need to create more than one
       Tmp File. See sections NOTES and CONFIGURATION in this manpage.
