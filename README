XWINREG(1)                 User Manual                        XWINREG(1)

NAME
       xwinreg - organize X windows into regions and do tiling layouts

SYNOPSIS
       xwinreg [-I]
               [-C|-T|-n|-N|-a|-fx|-fy|-fw|-fh|-wx|-wy|-ww|-wh]
               (-c|-f|-H|-h|[-l ...|-L...]|-M|-U|-v|-y)

REQUIREMENT
       bc, GNU bash, GNU grep, GNU sed, wmctrl, xprop, xwinpp

DESCRIPTION
       xwinreg(1) is a bash shell script that acts like a stupid third
       party tiling application on Xorg. It lets you to organize X
       windows into frames and regions and then to build your own
       layouts in a simple way. Therefore, xwinreg(1) uses xwinpp(1)
       to prepare a list of X window ids, and wmctrl(1) to interact
       with your EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window manager. See section
       CONCEPTION in this manpage.

OPTIONS
       -I, --input-file= FILE
              Obtain output of xwinpp(1) from FILE. If FILE is a hyphen,
              get output from xwinpp(1) by reading from standard input
              (pipe).

       -C, --conf-file= FILE
              Read variables from FILE. See section CONFIGURATION in
              this manpage.

       -T, --tmp-file= FILE
              Before layouting, xwinreg(1) creates a Tmp File, whose
              variables are needed by all other actions to work with.
              With this option you can specify a nonregular file.

       -n, --number-of-rows= INT
              Specify number of rows for grid layouting.

       -N, --number-of-cols= INT
              Specify number of columns for grid layouting.

       -a, --frame-alias= FRAMEALIAS
              Instead of options -fx, -fy, -fw and -fh specify an alias.
              See section CONFIGURATION in this manpage.

       -fx, --frame-x= PX
              Specify the left edge of the frame.

       -fw, --frame-width= PX
              Specify the WIDTH of the frame.

       -fh, --frame-height= PX
              Specify the HEIGHT of the frame.

       -wx, --workarea-x= PX
              Specify the left edge of the workarea.

       -wy, --workarea-y= PX
              Specify the top edge of the workarea.

       -ww, --workarea-width= PX
              Specify the WIDTH of the workarea.

       -wh, --workarea-height= PX
              Specify the HEIGHT of the workarea.

       -h, --help
              Display a short help.

       -v, --version
              Print current version of xwinreg.

       -k, --stack
              Used with action -y to keep region position, but cycle
              windows and SPLIT. Without this option region positions
              are cycled; together with windows and SPLIT.

              Used with action -y and options -w and -r with more than

                -L 1,max,grid-horizontal,alias:0,all

              xwinpp -F ./list -P 1 -p | xwinreg -I - \
                -L 1,max,grid-square-horizontal,alias:0,all

              xwinpp -F ./list -P 1 -p | xwinreg -I - \
                -L 1,max,maximize,alias:0,all

              xwinpp -F ./list -P 1 -p | xwinreg -I - \
                -L 1,1,maximize,alias:0,west \
                -L 2,max,horizontal,alias:0,east

              xwinpp -F ./list -P 1 -p | xwinreg -I - \

       To do some cycling (still with five windows in three regions):
              xwinreg -y -w -r all -d reverse

              xwinreg -y -w -r active -d clock

              xwinreg -y -w -r 1,3 -d anticlock

              xwinreg -y -d anticlock

              xwinreg -y -k -d clock

NOTES
       路   You may write all long commands and options without masking --.
           So, instead of --help you may use help.

       路   If no workarea geometry is set, xwinreg(1) uses _NET_WORKAREA.

       路   Currently, window decoration is not considered.

       路   If no frame geometry is set, _NET_WORKAREA is used as frame.
           Every new frame needs its own Tmp File. In other words: all
           layouting takes place in one frame. You can specify another
           Tmp File with option -T, or you may  create several Conf
           Files. See section CONFIGURATION in this manpage.

CONFIGURATIONS
       By default, xwinreg(1) needs no Conf File, because all important
       geometries will be calculated in the script. You can also use the
       relating options on command line. So, only use a Conf File, if
       you want to work with several frames (and several Tmp Files are
       needed) or if you need to set own aliases for frame and region
       geometries. Along with this programm comes an exemplary Conf
       File. Specify a Conf File with option -C or use XWINREG_CONF_FILE.
       You can set following parameters:

       enviroment variables:
              XWINREG_TMP_FILE=FILE
              XWINREG_INPUT_FILE=FILE

       normal scalar variables:
              workarea_x=PX
              workarea_y=PX
              workarea_width=PX
              workarea_height=PX
              frame_x=PX
              frame_y=PX
              frame_width=PX
              frame_height=PX
              row_number=INT
              col_number=INT

       associativ array variables (you can use it with above
       variables). You need to set them inside a function called
       __calculating_frame_alias respectively __calculating_region_alias
       and declare it with 'declare -gA frames' respectively 'declare
       -gA regions':

              frames[ALIAS]="X Y W H"
              regions[ALIAS]="X Y W H"

ENVIROMENT
       TMPDIR
              By default, Tmp File will be written as
              TMPDIR/xwinreg_default.tmp, otherwise as
              /tmp/xwinreg_default.tmp.

        XWINREG_TMP_FILE
              Specify this instead default setting and instead
              using XWINREG_TMP_FILE in a Conf File.

        XWINREG_CONF_FILE
              Use this instead of option -C, if you want to use a Conf
              File.

        XWINREG_INPUT_FILE
              Use this instead of option -I.

CHRONICLE
       First version (0.1.0.0) was finished on: 2014-02-10.

CONCEPTION
       xwinpp(1) reads a list with X window ids and does a preparing
       output with variables, which are going to be read by xwinreg(1). By
       using action layout or layout-abbrev a layout is generated and
       all specified windows are going to be ordered. In the course of
       layouting a Tmp File with some variables is created. Any other
       actions then need to access that Tmp File to work properly. Only
       above layout actions must be used in combination with  xwinpp(1);
       no windows to read are needed anymore.

       The layout is set on one desktop. Therefore, xwinreg(1)
       reads _NET_WORKAREA and determines a frame as scale base to
       have base geometry. In this frame xwinreg(1) arranges regions,
       which are filled rule-based with the windows. Windows are taken
       in list-order; the first window is set as first window in the
       first region. You can determine, how many windows a region should
       have (maximum is the number of imported windows). The windows
       are going to be split and positioned with following functions:
       maximize, vertical, horizontal, grid-vertical, grid-horizontal,
       grid-square-vertical, grid-square-horizontal.

       In other words: all layouting takes place in one frame. That
       one frame may have the geometry of the workspace or any other. To
       work with more than one frame, you need to create more than one
       Tmp File. See sections NOTES and CONFIGURATION in this manpage.
