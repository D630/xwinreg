NAME
       xwinreg-id - get prepared X window ids from xwinpp(1).

XWINREG
       Part of xwinreg(1).

SYNOPSIS
       xwinreg-id [-T] (-h|-I|-v)

REQUIREMENT
       GNU bash, grep, xwinpp

DESCRIPTION
       Just  as  xwinreg-calculate(1),  xwinreg-id(1)  is required for
       layouting with xwinreg-layout(1). Its purpose is  to  read  the
       ouput of xwinpp(1) and to create a Tmp File with its variables.

       In the wrapper script xwinreg(1) you may not call xwinreg-id(1)
       directly; it will be called, if you use the option -I to  indi‐
       cate an Input File.

OPTIONS
       -h     Display a short help.

       -I FILE
              Obtain  output  of  xwinpp(1)  from  FILE.  If FILE is a
              hyphen, get output from xwinpp(1) by reading from  stan‐
              dard input.

       -T FILE
              Specify a nonregular Tmp file.

       -v     Print current version of xwinreg-id(1).

ARGUMENTS
       FILE   Regular file or named pipe.

EXAMPLES
       xwinpp -F ./list -P 1 -p | xwinreg-id -I -

       xwinpp -F ./list -P 1 -p | xwinreg-id -I - -T ${Home}/tmp/xwin‐
       reg.tmp

       xwinreg-id -I - < <(xwinpp -F ./list -P 1 -p)

       xwinreg-id -I ./output-of-xwinpp

       xwinreg-id -I <(xwinpp -F ./list -P 1 -p)

ENVIROMENT
       TMPDIR By default, Tmp File will  be  written  as  TMPDIR/xwin‐
              reg_default.tmp, otherwise as /tmp/xwinreg_default.tmp.

       XWINREG_TMP_FILE
              Specify  this  instead default setting and instead using
              XWINREG_TMP_FILE in a Conf File.

       XWINREG_INPUT_FILE
              Use this instead of option -I.
